<!-- HEX: 0123456789ABCDEF ex) 0000FF = Blue -->
<!-- You can define color with a Decimal, Binary, or HEX value. HEX is the most used, because it's base 16 which means theres 16 characters used to define a color, while binary is only base 2 and decimal is only base 10. -->
<!--1111 1111 = 255 in Binary -->
<!-- The limit of an 8 bit binary is 255, which is why color wheels only go up to 255. Also HEX is better than Decimal & Binary because it's base 16 while the other 2 are base 10 and 2, giving it the most amount of characters to define a color.-->
